## 1. Git, gihub.
  Very useful parts about merge and pull request.

## 2. Linux, CLI, HTTP tools.

I didn't learn something new about Linux or CLI. But this fact was compensated
by almost intimidating complexness of HTTP :( I'll have to learn more in feature about HTTP 

## 3. Git Collaboration

Responsive web design very cool. But it seems very easy untill you have to try alone all this stuff. Then you understand your stupidity :( But I'm on my road. Really awesome technics such design patterns was in this part! Frohs are much worse then zombies by the way(imo).
