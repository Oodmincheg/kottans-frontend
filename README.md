## 0. Git, gihub.
  Very useful parts about merge and pull request.

## 1. Linux, CLI, HTTP tools.

I didn't learn something new about Linux or CLI. But this fact was compensated
by almost intimidating complexness of HTTP :( I'll have to learn more in feature about HTTP 

## 2. Git Collaboration

It was very intersting tasks at htmlAcademy in this part of course. Couple of css exersices was really hard.

Responsive web design very cool. But it seems very easy untill you have to try alone all this stuff. Then you understand your stupidity :( But I'm on my road. Really awesome technics such design patterns was in this part! Frohs are much worse then zombies by the way(imo).

Freecodecamp is SOOOOOOOOOO FUUUUUUUUN! Awesome stuff! I hope that I will return to another its parts in feature :) I'm in love with algoritms(but they aren't with me :( )

## 6. DOM

Both subtasks were very challenging. There is a lot off stuff in DOM-api(and this is only 1% I think). Really I'm not sure will I be able to recall something :D
And part 2 of algoritms was easier after part 1, but couple of tasks wer pretty cool. 

## 7. A Tiny JS World

Reviewed and approved by @OleksiyRudenko
The smallest task is a reason for a largest reflections. Neglection can be so harmful for your deployments. I was fixing small typos several times steeling time from @OleksiyRudenko and myself. I should be more careful next time if I want to become a web-developer.

## 8. Object Oriented JS

OOP course on udacity seems so difficult. It was very helpfull for me, but I could to understand it only in middle of the course. I think it would be a huuuge challenge without basic knowing OOP conception and basic knowin of realisation of this conceprion if JS.
